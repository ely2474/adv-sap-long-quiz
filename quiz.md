## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a business approach to software development that has advantage of reusable software parts and services.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Characteristics of SOA -
- Standardized Service Contracts: Services followed to a service type included express their purpose, express their capabalities, and formal used.
- Loose Coupling: Reducing loosening dependencies between service contract, service implementation and service demand.
- Abstraction: Positioning and design of service compositions.
- Service Reusability: Logic is divided by services with maximized reuse.
- Autonomy: It has primary benefits including increased reliability and behavioral predictability.
- Statelessness: It adds service scalability.
- Discoverability: The services discovered usually in a service registry.
- Composability: Services can break big problems into little problems to reusability principle.
- Interoperability: The services must use standards that allow subcribers to use the service.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices are a truth cloud-native architectural approach, by using them, they can update the code more easily, also it can use different bundle for different parts, and can be scale the parts independently of one another, and many more.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- The Benefits of Using Microservices -
- Independently deployable: The microservices model suitable neatly with the trend because it can do create small to an organization, cross-functional teams around service, and it can operate an agile fashion.
- Right tool for the job: An application typically shares a usual stack, with a big, relational database that supports the entire application.
- Precise scaling: The individual services can be individually deployed but they can be individually scaled.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- SOA has an enterprise scope while Microservices has an application scope.
- Both SOA and Microservices allow development teams to create build, deploy, and manage modern applications fully for cloud environments.
- Microservices gives precise advantages above SOA deployments.

6. Define Web Services.
- Web Services are any part of software that makes itself use over the internet and it uses standard messaging system.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- Benefits of Using Web Services -
- Exposing the Existing Function on the network: It allows exposing the functionality of existing code over the network, other applications can use funcionality of thy program.
- Interoperability: It allows various appllications to talk to each other and share a data and service with themselves.
- Standardized Protocol: All four layers such as Service Transport, XML Messaging, Service Description, and Service Discovery layers are use in well-defined protocols in the web services protocol stack.
- Low Cost Communication: It use SOAP over HTTP protocol, then you can use your existing low-cost internet for putting web services.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- Characteristics of Web Services -
- XML-Based: Web services uses XML at data representation and data transportation layers. XML removes any networking, operating system, and platform binding.
- Loosely Coupled: The web service interface may change over time without compromising the ability of client to interact with the service.
- Coarse-Grained: Java reveals their services through individual methods. Businesses and the interfaces that Java reveals must be coarse-grained.
- Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous: Synchronous applies to the binding of the client to the execution of the service, while asynchronous operations applies a client to invoke a service and execute other functions.
- Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs): Web services applies clients to invoke procedures, functions, and methods on remote objects using an XML-based protocol.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- The Distinct Roles in Web Services Architecture -
- Provider: It creates the web service and makes it use to client applications.
- Requestor: Requestor is none unless Client application needs to contact a web service.
- Broker:  Broker is none unless the application which gives access to the UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) to locate the web service.
- Publish: Provider informs the broker about the existing web service by using the broker's publish interface to make service available to clients.
- Find: The requestor refers the broker to locate published web service.
- Bind: With information it benefits from the broker such as service registry about the web service, requestor can be able to bind or invoke the web service.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- Web Services Components -
- SOAP: Means for Simple Object Access Protocol. A communication protocol that informs between applications.
- WSDL: Means for Web Services Description Language. It is an XML-based language for representing web services and for accessing them.
- UDDI: Means for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. It utilize WSDL to describes interfaces to web services.
- SOAP Web Services: It is the same platform and language independent.
